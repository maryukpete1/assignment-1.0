        <h2>Why I Joined the Program</h2>
        <p>
         I joined this program because I wanted to be independent, I wanted a change and I wanted to learn a skill. I picked back end engineering because it gives me  more opportunity if I ever decide to transition. I joined ALt school because it was one of the most recommended ones by my pees. I was told it would enable to have the ability to joggle trying to earn two different degrees and I would be able to learn at my own pace. Joining Alt school was the best decision I made last year as it gave me no choice but to sit up and meet individuals also fighting to learn and have good futures. It is no secret that there is money and a billion opportunities in tech for those that are ready to work hard for it
